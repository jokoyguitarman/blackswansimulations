Black Swan Simulations: Bomb in a Suspicious Bag
Scenario
A large grassroots community event is underway at a neighbourhood hard court with approximately 1,000 participants. At the height of the event, an unattended bag placed near the central seating area detonates unexpectedly, causing casualties, panic, severe confusion, and a complex crisis environment.
The Community Emergency and Engagement (C2E) Committee becomes the first and only organised response element for at least 15 minutes, which later extends due to delayed emergency services.
Unknown to the C2E, two terrorists remain on site:
•	One discreetly records the aftermath for propaganda.
•	One intends to conduct a suicide attack at a moment of maximum crowd density.
The situation is complicated by a developing media environment in which misinformation, communal tensions, and opportunistic narratives rapidly escalate.
Immediate Aftermath
Operational Conditions
The blast produces:
•	Dense smoke and dust.
•	Overturned chairs, metal structures, and tripping hazards.
•	Screams, chaotic movement, and contradictory accounts.
•	Significant obstruction of visibility around the blast centre.
C2E has no reliable sense of:
•	Number of casualties.
•	Severity of injuries.
•	Whether the incident is accidental or intentional.
•	Whether multiple devices exist
•	Whether the area remains safe for entry.
Volunteer Deployment
C2E dispatches volunteers to perform rapid visual sweeps. They will be given limited, zone-specific observable information (volunteer cards). No volunteer sees the entire picture.
This introduces natural reporting gaps:
•	Some see multiple casualties.
•	Others only see smoke and panicked movement.
•	Some overhear rumours.
•	Others misinterpret environmental cues.
These discrepancies form the core of the fog of war.
Media Environment
Even before volunteers return:
•	Attendees begin recording videos.
•	Short, low-quality clips are uploaded to TikTok, Instagram, Telegram.
•	Comments speculate wildly: “gas canister”, “bomb”, “electrical explosion”.
•	First racialised accusations emerge online, e.g.: “I saw Malay boys near the bag before it exploded.” “Why are Muslim youths always involved?” These are unverified and appear without evidence.
C2E is not immediately aware of these posts, but they shape the unfolding crisis.
Initial Volunteer Sweep
Operational Reports
Volunteers return with fragmented, partially inaccurate reports:
•	Casualties lying motionless, unsure if unconscious or seeking cover.
•	Blood observed in some zones but no full count.
•	Smoke obscuring injuries.
•	Choke points forming at key exits.
•	People shouting about a “second bomb” based on panic, not fact.
•	Claims that “someone saw a suspicious person running away.”
C2E must synthesise these inconsistent accounts into an actionable plan.
Media-Related Observations from Volunteers
Some volunteers report:
•	Individuals filming injured victims up close.
•	A resident livestreaming inflammatory claim.
•	A bystander accusing Malay Muslim attendees of involvement.
•	Arguments breaking out between groups after racialised accusations spread.
•	A rumour circulating that the “suspect bag belonged to a Malay participant.”
None of this is confirmed. C2E must decide what is credible, what requires intervention, and what risks inflaming tensions.
Escalation of Media and Communal Tension
Emergency Services Delay
At the 10-minute mark, 995 and 999 inform C2E:
•	Ambulances and police cannot arrive on time due to traffic.
•	C2E must manage the crisis longer and more independently.
Viral Misinformation
A video uploaded online—distorted by smoke and movement—appears to show a group of Malay youths near the blast site moments before detonation. It goes viral rapidly.
Consequences:
•	Comments call the incident “Islamist terrorism”.
•	Angry posts circulate urging security to “separate the Malays”.
•	Old social media posts about unrelated local incidents resurface to reinforce prejudice.
On-Site Racial Tension
Inside the event grounds:
•	Some non-Malay attendees begin avoiding Malay families.
•	A minor altercation occurs when someone yells, “The attackers are among us.”
•	A Malay volunteer assigned to evacuation is confronted by a frightened resident.
These tensions directly interfere with evacuation, triage, and crowd management.
Journalists Arriving Early
Freelance journalists or bloggers appear earlier than first responders:
•	Filming casualty zones.
•	Asking volunteers for statements.
•	Posting unverified observations.
•	Photographing visibly Malay families disproportionately.
The C2E must manage these interactions while protecting affected groups.
Hidden Adversaries
Propaganda Operative
One terrorist blend into the crowd:
•	Filming the chaos.
•	Capturing footage of racial confrontations.
•	Intending to use edited clips to present the event as a communal conflict.
•	Benefitting from every instance of misinformation or public accusation.
Suicide Attacker
The second terrorist:
•	Waits for opportunities created by disorder.
•	Targets crowded evacuation routes, choke points, or triage clusters.
•	Benefits from any uncontrolled congregation caused by misinformation, panic, or media activity.
Neither is initially observable to volunteers.
Core Objectives for the C2E Team
Objective 1: Evacuate 1,000 Participants
•	Manage bottlenecks.
•	Prevent discriminatory or chaotic self-segregation.
•	Keep evacuees calm despite misinformation.
Objective 2: Establish a Medical Triage
•	Based on incomplete, evolving data from volunteers.
•	Prioritise severely injured despite unclear casualty numbers.
•	Shield casualty zones from intrusive filming.
Objective 3: Manage Media and Mitigate Communal Tension
•	Address online racialised misinformation.
•	Prevent on-site harassment of Malay Muslim attendees.
•	Guide volunteers on what they may or may not say.
•	De-escalate emerging ethnic or religious confrontation.
•	Counter the narrative that the attack is linked to any community without evidence.
Objective 4: Coordinate with Emergency Services
•	Maintain accurate updates despite fog of war.
•	Identify safe access points for delayed responders.
•	Report potential secondary threats based on volunteer observations.
 
Universal Injects
(Delivered to all groups simultaneously. These shape the overall operational environment.)
Universal Inject 1 – Initial Explosion (T+0)
A sudden explosion occurs at the hard court. Smoke, dust, and debris obscure visibility. Panic spreads rapidly. People run in multiple directions, screaming. The extent of casualties is unknown.
Universal Inject 2 – Fragmented Early Reports (T+5)
Volunteers sent to assess the situation return with inconsistent information:
•	“I saw five people down.”
•	“I only saw smoke.”
•	“Someone said there is a second device.”
•	“A man ran away after the blast.”
No two accounts match.
Universal Inject 3 – Emergency Services Delay (T+10)
Dispatch (995 and 999) informs the coordination centre:
“Traffic congestion is severe. Ambulances and police cannot reach your location within the initial 15-minute estimate.”
Universal Inject 4 – Viral Video Circulates (T+10)
A short clip showing the explosion aftermath appears online. Due to poor visibility, it appears that Malay youths are standing near the blast area. Online commenters claim:
•	“Malay boys planted the bomb.”
•	“This is extremist terrorism.”
•	“Keep the Malays away from the exits.”
Universal Inject 5 – Journalist Arrives (T+12)
A freelance journalist arrives before emergency services. He begins filming casualties and asks:
“Is it true the attacker was a radicalised Malay youth?”
Universal Inject 6 – Crowd Tension Escalation (T+15)
A dispute erupts near the evacuation zone. An attendee shouts:
“The attackers are among us! The Malays are responsible!”
Fear and confusion escalate.
Role-Specific Injects
(Delivered only to the relevant functional team.)
Evacuation Team Injects
Evacuation Inject E1 – Exit Congestion (T+6)
A major exit becomes clogged as more than 150 people attempt to leave simultaneously. A child has fallen, and several attendees are at risk of trampling.
Evacuation Inject E2 – Request to Segregate Malays (T+11)
A fearful resident approaches the Evacuation Team:
“For safety, please separate the Malays from the rest.”
Evacuation Inject E3 – Suspicious Individual (T+14)
A volunteer reports:
“There is a man standing near Exit B with a backpack. He isn’t evacuating.”
(This is the suicide attacker’s location in the scenario.)
Triage Team Injects
Triage Inject T1 – Unclear Casualty Count (T+6)
Volunteers report conflicting casualty numbers:
•	“Three critical injuries.”
•	“I saw at least seven.”
•	“One person has stopped moving.”
Triage Inject T2 – On-Site Filming at Triage Area (T+12)
A bystander films traumatised victims receiving first aid. A family pleads for privacy.
Triage Inject T3 – Accusations from a Patient (T+15)
An injured attendee becomes agitated and shouts:
“I saw the Malay boys laughing before the explosion! They did this!”
Media/Communications Team Injects
Media Inject M1 – Fake Voice Note (T+9)
A viral WhatsApp audio note begins circulating:
“There is a second bomb. The attacker was a Malay male. Stay away from the CC.”
Media Inject M2 – Amplified Online Claims (T+11)
A Telegram channel posts:
“Confirmed: Islamist terror attack at the community event.”
“This is why we must separate communities.”
Media Inject M3 – Press Demand for Confirmation (T+12)
The journalist asks again:
“Can you confirm the attacker was Malay? The public deserves transparency.”
Optional: Interdependencies (Recommended for Realism)
To produce a richer simulation:
•	Inject E3 (suspicious man with backpack) should trigger an internal alert to Media/Comms and Triage teams.
•	Inject M1–M3 should influence Evacuation decisions when residents refuse to stand near Malay families.
•	Inject T3 should prompt Media/Comms to prepare a counter-narrative and Evacuation to adjust crowd flow.
•	Inject Universal 6 should require multi-team coordination.
