CONNECTION SUMMARY
==================

Main Timeline Flow:
T+0 → T+5 → T+6 → T+9 → T+10 → T+11 → T+12 → T+14 → T+15

Decision Points Branch Off:
- T+6: Triage Decision 3A branches off
- T+10: Context established, Evacuation Decision branches off
- T+12: Triage Decision 3B branches off, Media Decision branches off
- T+14: Security Decision branches off

All decisions can be made in parallel once available - they don't block the timeline.
Consequences occur after decisions are executed, but timeline continues regardless.
